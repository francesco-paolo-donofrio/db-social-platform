MySQL Exercise: Project with Milestones
In this project, I am beginning an exercise with MySQL, following multiple milestones to structure a database and interact with it through SQL queries. Each milestone is designed to enhance my understanding of data modeling and entity relationships.

Milestones
1Ô∏è‚É£ Milestone 1: ER Diagram
Identify the main entities and their relationships.
Define fields and constraints:
Use UNIQUE to ensure value uniqueness where needed.
Use NOT NULL to specify mandatory values.
The ER diagram will be exported as an image and uploaded to the repository.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Milestone 2: SQL Queries
Create a new database in phpMyAdmin and import the provided db.sql file.
Write the required queries, referring to the PDF file to verify the correct number of results for each query.
üåü Bonus: Post Tags
Implement tags for posts, where each tag is a single word with no spaces. Tags can be freely created by users when creating a post, with no limit on the number of tags they can use.
